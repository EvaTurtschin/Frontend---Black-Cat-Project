for Frontend Developer Course:

Create a button labeled "Get Cat Fact". Upon clicking this button, execute a GET request using fetch. The response to this request will contain a random cat fact.
URL: https://catfact.ninja/fact
After receiving a successful response, display the random cat fact on your webpage.
If the request encounters an error, display it on the page and highlight it in red.
Each time the button is clicked, a new request should be made, resulting in a new cat fact being displayed.
Feel free to style it according to your preferences.
